Here is my analysis of 106 Q2 public company in eps, operation income, net profit after tax. The data is from taiwan market observation post system.

**Here the question I would like to find the answer is: Which industry have the best perfomance in taiwan?**

I think we can get some investment or career information in taiwan from the public eps data.

The more detail you can see my analysis. These analysis are just my personal analysis for everyone reference, not for the investment or career suggestion. If you need any career or investiment suggestion, please ask professional financial consultant.

Thanks!
